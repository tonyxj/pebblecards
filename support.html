        Here are known issues for the latest version of Pebble Cards. Support is provided for the latest version only.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Settings are not being reflected on the watch, and/or settings screen shows values from Pebble Cards v1.2 or lower.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Solution: reinstall the Pebble mobile app BETA on your phone.
            </li>
            <li>
              If that does not fix the issue, and you have access to the Pebble mobile app, perform a "clean install" of SDK 2.0 BETA:
              <ol>
                <li>"Forget" the Pebble on my phone's Bluetooth pairing settings.</li>
                <li>Delete the Pebble mobile app from my phone.</li>
                <li>Put the Pebble into Recovery mode (hold back, up, and select button until "loading..." appears).</li>
                <li>Reinstall the Pebble mobile app.</li>
                <li>Pair the Pebble with my phone.</li>

              <h4>
                Why does the Pebble mobile app tells me I need to "update" my watch and app when I already have the latest version?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Pebble Cards requires Pebble firmware 2.0 BETA to be installed on both the <strong>watch</strong> and <strong>smartphone</strong>, which must be manually installed from <a href="https://developer.getpebble.com/2/getting-started/">https://developer.getpebble.com/2/getting-started/</a>. Note that this is BETA software and is not released to the general public yet, meaning it is still in development and may not be as stable.
              </p>

              <h4>
                How do I configure the cards? Is there a companion iOS/Android phone app?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Pebble Cards is configured within the official Pebble mobile app. Go to the list of watchapps and click on the circle icon (iOS) or gear icon (Android) to launch the Settings Screen.
              </p>

              <h4>
                What is Day/Night/Auto Display mode?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Day mode sets the watch display to black-on-white and Night mode sets it to white-on-black. Auto switches between Day and Night modes at 6:00 and 18:00.
              </p>

              <h4>
                What is Vibrate on Hour?
              </h4>
              <p>
                When enabled, Vibrate on Hour vibrates the watch on the hour (okay, that was pretty obvious, but the next part isn't). Vibrate on Hour only works when Pebble Cards is running.
              </p>

              <h4>
                Why are my card settings not being saved?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Press the Save button to keep your changes. Closing the Settings Screen with any other method will discard your changes.

              </h4>
              <p>
                Cards update on the hour, except for:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Transit: every 1 minute</li>
                <li>World Clock: every 1 minute</li>
                <li>Battery: every 5 minutes</li>

              <h4>
                Calendar: Why are my events not showing?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Pebble Cards is able to access calendar events from Google Calendar only; make sure you are logged in to Google through the button at the bottom of the Settings Screen. Also, Pebble Cards will only show the most events from today and tomorrow; events that start after tomorrow will not be displayed.
              </p>

              <h4>
                Calendar: Why can't Pebble Cards access events on my phone's calendar instead?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Pebble Cards is built to support both iOS and Android. That means it cannot rely on any platform-specific technologies, such as accessing data from native phone apps (e.g. Calendar, Contacts, Notes, Reminders, Phone, Messages, etc.).
              </p>

              <h4>
                Weather: What do I enter in the Location field?
              </h4>
              <p>
                The Weather card gets data from Yahoo, and the Location field is search query for the location. Pebble Cards will use the first location returned in the search. To see what queries will result in the right location, visit <a href="http://woeid.rosselliot.co.nz">woeid.rosselliot.co.nz</a> to test a few queries. In most cases, exclude punctuation marks, such as commas (e.g. "London ON", "Chelmsford UK").
              </p>

              <h4>
                Sports Team: What do I enter in the Team Alias field?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Team Alias is the abbreviated form of the sports team. To find the correct team alias, visit <a href="http://scores.nbcsports.msnbc.com/ticker/ticker.html">wscores.nbcsports.msnbc.com/ticker/ticker.html</a> and find your team.
              </p>

              <h4>
                Driving Time: What is the API Key field?
              </h4>
              <p>
                The Driving Time card uses <a href="http://developer.mapquest.com">MapQuest API</a> to calculate the route. The default API key that Pebble Cards uses (when the field is blank or set to the string "Optional") has a limited number of API calls per day. In the event that Pebble Cards exceeds this limit, you can use your own API key instead.
              </p>

              <h4>
                Transit: What transit agencies are supported?
              </h4>
              <p>
                The Transit card uses live GPS data from <a href="http://www.nextbus.com/predictor/agencySelector.jsp">NextBus</a>. The list of supported agencies can be found in <a href="http://webservices.nextbus.com/service/publicXMLFeed?command=agencyList">this XML document</a>. Note that not all transit agencies have enabled the ability to access data from the NextBus API.
              </p>

              <h4>
                Custom: What? How?
              </h4>
              <p>
                The custom card displays content from a JSON response from any URL. It is intended for developers only, so please don't send me emails asking "What URL do I use?" For example, the default URL <a href="http://keanulee.com/pebblecards/custom_sample.php?name=John">http://keanulee.com/pebblecards/custom_sample.php?name=John</a> responds with:
              </p>
              <pre>{
  "content" : "Hello John,\nWelcome to Pebble Cards!",
  "refresh_frequency" : 30
}</pre>
              <blockquote><code>content</code> is the content to display (required); and<br />
                <code>refresh_frequency</code> is the auto-refresh interval in minutes (defaults to 60 minutes if 0 or not specified)<br /><br />
                All other fields are ignored.
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                You can pass in query parameters in the URL to customize the response. If you think a lot of other users would benefit from your custom card, contact me and I could create a new card using this URL.

              <p>
                The Apple iOS Developer Program restricts the number of devices that can be used for beta testing. This means that until Pebble 2.0 is released publicly, the Pebble 2.0 mobile app for iOS may not be available for public download.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are a Pebble developer, you can request access to the mobile app through Pebble's website. (I have intentionally excluded a link; if you are a Pebble developer, you would already know where to go.)

                I've got a suggestion for Pebble Cards.
              </h4>
              <p>
                That's great, and I'd love to hear it! With that said I may or may not end up implement your feature.
              </p>

              <h4>
                Why won't you implement my awesome feature?
              </h4>
              <p>
                One reason is that it doesn't fit with the purpose of Pebble Cards, which is a watch screen the displays customizable information. Apps that "control" other things are great and all, but sometimes functionalty should be seperated into different apps.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another reason is that it's not technically possible. Pebble Cards uses the PebbleKit JavaScript framework, which doesn't allow access to phone-specfic information (e.g. Calendar, Contacts, Notes, Reminders, Phone, Messages, etc.).
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly I may not add a feature because I don't like the idea, or implementing it would be too costly (money and/or time). I work on Pebble Cards on my spare time, and sometimes I spend my spare time on <a href="http://www.rockstargames.com/V/">other</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiing">things</a>.

                What is "Pebble"?
              </h4>
              <p>
                I really don't know how you got here, but <a href="https://getpebble.com">getpebble.com</a> can answer that question.
              </p>

              <h4>
                Why Pebble "Cards"?
              </h4>
              <p>
                I was originally trying to replicate "cards" from <a href="http://www.google.ca/landing/now/">Google now</a>, but I soon realized that even those cards displayed too much information for a smartwatch. Pebble Cards aims to provide even more concise information, with customization options much more in the user's control and much less <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/22/google-now-2/">creepy</a>.
              </p>

              <h4>
                All I see on the Pebble Cards homepage is a giant pure CSS/JS Pebble watch that scrolls through a few static, out-of-date messages. Is this whole thing just another <a href="https://www.facebook.com/getpebble/posts/731623600200874/?comment_id=7745120">convoluted escapade that most likely doesn't work</a>?
              </h4>
              <p>
                No, it's actually quite a simple app that (most likely) works.
